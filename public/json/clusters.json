Peter Thiel discussed the importance of Steve Jobs' approach, which focused on making a transformative product for a small group of people, rather than rapidly scaling a product which may only show promise in a certain context. This approach is opposed to the pervasive norms of the tech industry, which tends to scale products to as many people and contexts as possible. Furthermore, few people today have the practice of principled software design that Steve Jobs demonstrated, as the practice has gone extinct in favor of assembly-line replicas. \n\nMusk's recent firing of hundreds of engineers is mentioned, as well as the impacts it had, and the implications of tech debt. The analogies of tech debt to financial debt can be good, but the analogy breaks down in some scenarios. It is possible for something to be tech debt one moment, and then after rescoping not be deemed as tech debt, or vice versa. ",

        "response": "\nThis collection of Tweets revolve around the idea of creative work, knowledge workers, and automation. Kurt Vonnegut's quote on creativity encourages readers to practice any art or skill without expectation of money or fame, but to explore and experience changes within themselves. \n\nAnother idea touched upon is the concept of digital gardens, or keeping a shareable copy of ideas for the collective intelligence. It can help contribute to the growth of knowledge. \n\nThe discussion on digital transformation of work relates to the idea of automation, remote working challenges, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. It expands to policy and regulation debates that arise around these concepts. \n\nFinally, one Tweet highlights an article by @ejames_c on Tools for Thought. This article explains why this concept is valuable and makes it free to the public. \n\nIn conclusion, the Tweets touch on various aspects of creative work and knowledge workers, from automation to remote working challenges, to the importance of creativity. There are also sources that offer insight into the topic and even provide free articles for the public to access.",

        "response": "\nThe tweets revolve around the theme of ancient ruins and their allure to the modern world. John Milton's sentence contains an entire essay and its breathtaking beauty is compared to a blue whale in the ocean. The Ancient Theater of Delphi was built from limestone of the Parnassos Mountain in 4th century BC. It offered an audience a wonderful view and entire shelter with a view of an olive valley. The volumetric geopolitics of burial shows how death cultures and economies are illuminated through practices and embodied experiences of interment. It is not just the broken columns, but the marbled silence that captures the brevity of all human endeavors. Ancient Egyptians pushed and pulled monuments in a baffling way, leaving no traces of their method. The world's first mass smoking society condemned cigarettes, and our Book of the Week examines how they developed in the USSR despite the lack of mass production or advertising.",

        "response": "\nThis set of Tweets speaks to the concept of mortality, and how our physical bodies ultimately succumb to the inevitability of death. Through the metaphor of our body being \u201cstirred\u201d by life briefly, before submitting itself to the instruments of Time, the Tweets allude to how life is transient and, ultimately, death is unavoidable. Claudio Arrau is discussed, illustrating how his interpretation of this concept is \u201cpinnacle\u201d and how others try to search and interpret it in ways that capture the essence of mortality more profoundly. Furthermore, the concept of doing something \u201cfor the last time\u201d is seen to be more powerful than thinking about death explicitly. The Tweets also delve into how the past is always changing, and how different contemporaries inhabit different times. Lastly, a link to a pdf discussing municipalist housing practices is given, as is a link to the first work of fiction to use proof theory notation. In conclusion, the Tweets present a thought-provoking perspective about mortality and how the concept affects us on an individual and collective level.",

        "response": "\nThese Tweets discuss a variety of archaeological sites from around the world, from Neolithic villages in Scotland to the Gaurishvara Temple in India and the Ark of Bukhara in Uzbekistan. The most heavily-discussed site is Skara Brae, a Neolithic village in Scotland that was uncovered in 1850 after a severe storm stripped away a large knoll to reveal 10 interlinked houses complete with stone hearths, beds, cupboards, and even flushing toilets. Other archaeological sites discussed include the Rock-Art Sites of Tadrart Acacus in Libya and the Gaurishvara Temple in India. The Tweets also talk about the popularity of red lipstick in Ancient Egypt and the unique styles of sculpture found in Rococo, Baroque, and Indian artwork. Ultimately, these Tweets provide an overview of some of the most fascinating archaeological sites from around the world and the unique art, sculpture, and lipstick styles that have existed throughout history.",

They articulate the goals and objectives of the product, including who it is for and what problem it solves, as well as how it is different from other solutions. Ownership of the roadmap can vary, but they are most often created and managed by a product manager. The roadmap should be shared with stakeholders, sales and development teams, and be regularly checked in on.

For both, the practice of Bionic Reading has allowed them to manage their time better and enjoy reading, rather than dread it.\n\nThe Bionic Reading approach includes a series of PDSA loops to experiment with improving value-based reading, such as how to select relevant topics and how long to spend reading each topic. The process is not an easy one, but it has provided both of the narrators with interesting insights.
